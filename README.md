# Crash2D

## About
This library was created for simple collision detection without having to use a full blown physics engine. Future plans include a physics library on top of this collision library so that each can be used separately or in concert with each other.

## Using the Library
You can obtain a binary of the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/fundies/SAT/releases) page. There is a demo included which uses SFML for rendering.

## Compiling from Source
The project was originally written in the CodeLite IDE but you can use any IDE or CLI you like.

## License and Contributing
Adaptations of the project are welcome but you are encouraged to send fixes upstream to the master repository. The project is licensed under the permissive [MIT license](LICENSE).
